What example to this might be the criminals we see in the newspaper those are only a small portion of the true criminals, because the rest are never caught. Another example would be fossils. The fossils that we discover of extinct animals are only a portion of the true number of animals that lives on earth, so our conception of The history of earths floor and fauna is different than what actually was
